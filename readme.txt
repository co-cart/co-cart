Ship your headless WooCommerce storefront faster. CoCart is the REST API built for Next.js, React, Vue, and any modern frontend — developer-first.

== Description ==

You’ve chosen WooCommerce for your store. Now you want a modern frontend — React, Next.js, Astro, Vue — without being locked into WordPress themes. That’s exactly what [CoCart](https://cocartapi.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink) is built for.

CoCart gives WooCommerce a proper frontend REST API: cookie-less session management built for stateless frontends, authentication that makes sense, and CORS support built-in. Cart sessions, authentication, and product data. Scale up when you're ready.

In active development since 2018, with a ★4.9/5 rating from the developers who build headless stores with it every day.

= 🚀 Make your first API call in 2 minutes =

Install CoCart and you're immediately ready to call the API — no setup required:

`
curl -X POST https://your-store.com/wp-json/cocart/v2/cart/add-item \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id": "123", "quantity": 1}'
`

= Why CoCart? =

WooCommerce’s Store API can be used headless, but it was designed for the Gutenberg block editor ecosystem. Its session model relies on nonces passed via response headers — suited for anonymous single-session shoppers, but the nonce is tied to WordPress's nonce lifecycle and less straightforward to persist across sessions or devices.

CoCart is purpose-built for headless from day one: cart sessions identified by a persistent key — no nonces, no cookies — a single unified endpoint set for both product and cart data, and authentication for customers that supports any shop requirement.

= Features =

**🚀 Session management that works**

* 🔐 **Cookie-less sessions** — database-stored, built for concurrent requests and stateless frontends
* 👤 **Guest customer support** — full cart session support for unauthenticated shoppers, no login required
* 🔄 **Load any session into checkout** — hand off to WooCommerce’s native checkout with any payment gateway

**🛒 Essential cart operations**

* ✅ **Add, update, and remove items** via simple POST/PUT/DELETE requests
* 🔎 **Product search** — query by name, SKU, or ID, authenticated or not, with flexible filtering
* 💸 **Name Your Price support** — donation-based and flexible pricing built in
* 📦 **Bulk cart requests** — combine multiple operations into a single API call

**💻 Developer experience, done right**

* 🔑 **Flexible authentication** — email, username, or phone login; no admin API keys to manage
* 🌍 **CORS support built in** — first-party CORS handling; your frontend connects without configuration hell
* 🧩 **180+ filters** — customize every response, add logic without writing new routes
* 📊 **Cart insights** — monitor active, expiring, and expired sessions from the dashboard
* 🛠 **Works with your existing stack** — built on WooCommerce Data Stores with familiar hooks for broad plugin compatibility

**🎯 Battle-tested**

* Tested with every major WooCommerce release
* Multisite compatible

= Who builds with CoCart? =

**Frontend developers** shipping storefronts in Next.js, React, Vue, Nuxt, Astro, Svelte, or Remix — keep WooCommerce as the commerce engine and own the entire frontend experience, from server components to fully static builds.

**Mobile app developers** building shopping apps in React Native, Flutter, Swift, or Kotlin — the same cart key works across devices, so a customer can start a cart on their phone and finish on the web.

**Agencies** delivering high-performance client storefronts — reuse one proven commerce backend across projects while every client gets a custom frontend, free of WordPress theme constraints.

**Product teams going beyond the browser** — progressive web apps with persistent carts, in-store kiosks, point-of-sale screens, even chat and voice commerce. Anywhere a customer can shop, CoCart can serve the cart.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress v6.7
* WooCommerce v9.0
* PHP v8.2

= Recommended Requirements =

* WordPress v6.7 or higher.
* WooCommerce v10.0 or higher.
* PHP v8.3 or higher.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of CoCart, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "CoCart" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Upgrading =

Review [the changelog](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/#developers) before upgrading. CoCart follows [Semver](https://semver.org/) — MAJOR versions may contain breaking API changes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who is CoCart for? =

**Developers** building headless or decoupled WooCommerce storefronts. If you can make HTTP requests and read JSON, you’re ready. No WordPress development experience required — CoCart abstracts the complexity and gives you clean, predictable API responses. Perfect for:

- Frontend developers building with React, Next.js, Astro, Vue, or any modern framework
- Agencies creating high-performance client storefronts
- Mobile app developers who need a reliable eCommerce API

= How do I get started? =

Install WooCommerce and configure your store, then install and activate CoCart. You’re immediately ready to call the API — no additional setup required. Check the [installation section](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/#installation) for requirements, then follow the [API reference](https://cocartapi.com/docs/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink) to start building.

= What happens to the free community version if I don’t upgrade? =

Nothing. The free community stays fully functional. It covers sessions, authentication, CORS, cart operations, and product queries — everything you need to build a working headless cart. CoCart Plus adds advanced features like coupons, shipping, fees, and rate limiting for when you need them.

= Is my store or customer data sent to CoCart’s servers? =

No. CoCart runs entirely on your WordPress server. No customer data, cart contents, or store information is ever sent to CoCart’s servers. The plugin collects no analytics without your consent. [Full privacy policy →](https://cocartapi.com/privacy-policy/)

= Will my existing WooCommerce plugins still work? =

Plugins that modify backend functionality — payment gateways, shipping, tax, inventory — continue to work. Plugins that only modify the PHP frontend (themes, shortcodes, widgets) won’t apply to the REST API layer, which is expected in a headless setup.

= Why use CoCart instead of WooCommerce’s Store API? =

WooCommerce’s Store API can be used headless, but it was designed for the Gutenberg block editor ecosystem. Its session model relies on nonces passed via response headers — suited for anonymous single-session shoppers, but tied to WordPress’s nonce lifecycle and less straightforward to persist across sessions or devices. CoCart is purpose-built for headless: cart sessions identified by a persistent key and authentication that supports any shop requirement.

= Why does CoCart use a custom session handler? =

Headless storefronts are stateless by nature — there’s no browser session to rely on, and concurrent requests are common. CoCart’s session handler is cookie-less, database-stored, and safe for concurrent requests, with full support for both guest and authenticated customers from day one.

= Can I run WordPress on one domain and my storefront on another? =

Yes — that’s the primary use case CoCart is built for. Enable CORS via the [free CORS add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cocart-cors/) or manually via [the filter documented here](https://cocartapi.com/docs/#filters-api-access-cors-allow-all-cross-origin-headers).

= Can I call other WordPress or WooCommerce APIs alongside CoCart? =

Yes. CoCart doesn’t block or replace any other API. Once authenticated, your frontend can access CoCart endpoints, WooCommerce endpoints, and any custom endpoints you’ve built — all at the same time.

= Can CoCart support SSO? =

CoCart does not implement SSO itself — it authenticates customers against WordPress user accounts using Basic Auth or JWT (via add-on). It does not natively speak SAML, OAuth 2.0, or OIDC.

That said, CoCart can work alongside SSO in a headless setup. The typical pattern is:

1. Your identity provider (Google, Okta, Auth0, etc.) authenticates the user via your frontend.
2. A WordPress SSO plugin (e.g. one handling OAuth 2.0 or SAML) creates or matches a WordPress user account for that identity.
3. Your frontend then authenticates with CoCart using Basic Auth or JWT as that WordPress user.

The SSO layer handles identity; CoCart handles the commerce session from that point on. Whether this works smoothly depends on how your chosen SSO plugin manages WordPress user creation and session state — that part is outside CoCart's scope.

= Does CoCart work on multisite? =

Yes. Install and activate CoCart on each site where you want to use it.

= Can I change the format of API responses? =

Yes — there are 180+ filters available to customize responses, add fields, or remove data you don’t need.

= Is "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" plugin supported? =

No — it restricts tax calculation to WooCommerce Blocks and Jetpack only. We don’t recommend it for headless setups. [TaxJar for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/) (v3.2.5+) is supported.

= Does CoCart work with caching plugins like LiteSpeed or WP Rocket? =

Yes. CoCart automatically excludes its API endpoints from page caching, so caching plugins won't interfere with cart sessions or API responses. LiteSpeed Cache is explicitly supported out of the box. Though, some hosts may require manual configuration to exclude CoCart API endpoints.

= How are cart sessions identified without cookies? =

Each cart is assigned a unique cart key, which your frontend passes as a request header or query parameter on subsequent API calls. This makes sessions fully stateless and safe for concurrent requests — no cookies, no session conflicts. See the [session documentation](https://cocartapi.com/docs/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink) for implementation details.

= Is there a hosted version, or does it run on my server? =

CoCart runs entirely on your WordPress server — there's no external service, no cloud dependency, and no data leaving your environment. You own your stack.

= Where can I report bugs? =

On the [CoCart GitHub repository](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues) or in the #bug-report channel of the [Discord community](https://cocartapi.com/community/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink). Search first to avoid duplicates.

= Where can I find more answers? =

Check the [full FAQ on cocartapi.com](https://cocartapi.com/faq/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink) or [browse the documentation](https://cocartapi.com/docs/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink).

== v4.9.1 - 20th July, 2026 ==

### Bug Fixes

* REST API: Fixed adding to cart via the v2 add item controller not checking stock for the combined quantity when an item already existed in the cart, allowing the cart to exceed available stock.
* REST API: Fixed the "Update Cart" callback not checking stock before setting a new item quantity, allowing the cart to be updated beyond available stock.
* Plugin: Fixed `cocart_update_plugin_suggestions` scheduled action never running via WP-Cron or WP-CLI — the callback was only registered on `admin_init` and the updater class only loaded when `is_admin()` was true, so Action Scheduler could not find a registered callback and the action was never rescheduled. Fixes [#576](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues/576) reported by [@isam-aqu](https://github.com/isam-aqu).

### Change

* REST API: Standardized "not enough stock" error messages across v1 and v2 cart controllers into a single consistent format.

### Compatibility

* Plugin: Updated styling for the WooCommerce floating admin header refreshed in WooCommerce v10.9.

== v4.9.0 - 12th July, 2026 ==

### What's New?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> PHP version 8.2 is the minimum requirement to install and use CoCart. PHP 7.4, 8.0, and 8.1 are all past end-of-life/security support so to help manage development resources to maintain CoCart, it will no longer be tested on these versions. Running CoCart on PHP 8.2 not only ensures you are secure but it also improves the performance of the CoCart API. Thank you for your understanding.

* REST API: Added ETag support for all cart endpoints (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) enabling conditional requests with `If-None-Match` header for immediate use.
* REST API: Added ETag support for product endpoints (products, categories, tags, attributes, reviews).
* REST API: Added `CoCart-Cache` response header indicating cache status: `HIT`, `MISS`, or `SKIP`.
* REST API: Added `_skip_cache` query parameter to bypass caching for individual requests.
* REST API: Added `stale-while-revalidate` directive to cacheable routes (products) for improved performance.
* REST API: Added check for `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header if it exists during authentication.
* WordPress Dashboard: New integrations page to provide more control over which supported plugin is running when making a CoCart request.

* Plugin: New settings page providing quick easy control of CoCart without touching code for the following:
* * CORS and allowed origin.
* * Authorization header server variable.
* * Session expiration for guest and logged-in users.
* * "Load Cart from Session" feature.
* * "Name Your Price" feature.

> Settings show a locked state when controlled by an external filter with a link providing information as to what and where.

### Bug Fixes

* REST API: Requests made via the WordPress REST API batch endpoint were not recognized and caused a fatal error when adding items.
* REST API: Shipping address fields were blank after submitting billing-only details — billing fields now mirror to shipping when `ship_to_different_address` is not set, matching WooCommerce checkout behaviour. Shipping packages now also return correctly after a complete address is saved.
* REST API: Slugs, permalinks and attribute names with non-ASCII characters (e.g., Chinese, Arabic) are now returned decoded instead of encoded across all product and cart endpoints.
* REST API: Authentication not determining user in time when `rest_url_prefix` filter is used causing several cloned guest sessions with cart items.
* REST API: Fixed fatal error when adding an invalid product to cart via v2 controller due to missing `WP_Error` check after product validation.
* REST API: Corrected `Last-Modified` header in GMT per HTTP spec with more robust date parsing.
* Plugin: Fixed `cocart_deprecated_filter()` returning `null` when the debug log was active, causing callers to receive no value from the deprecation wrapper.

#### PHP 8.2+ Fixes

* REST API: Fixed warnings for undefined array keys `cart_item_data` and `cart_item_key` in v1 add item controller.
* Session: Fixed warning for undefined array key `total` in session handler cart hash generation.
* Plugin: Fixed warnings for undefined array key `count` when database queries return no results in cart counting functions.
* Plugin: Fixed warning for undefined variable `$per_page` in admin plugin search.
* Plugin: Fixed deprecated `${var}` string interpolation syntax in plugin update screen.

### Change

* Session: Removed the max expiration exceed limit of 30 days to allow adjusting the lifetimes via the `cocart_cart_expiring` and `cocart_cart_expiration` filters as needed.

> Dev note: You will still be warned "Keeping sessions for longer than X days can cause performance issues and larger session tables."

### Improvements

* REST API: Slight performance increase by preventing admin content from loading in the background for every REST request made.
* REST API: `cocart_upload_file()` and `cocart_upload_image_from_url()` now use a `try/finally` block to guarantee the `upload_dir` filter is always removed, even when an exception is thrown during upload.
* REST API: `cocart_upload_image_from_url()` now uses `wp_parse_url()` to extract the filename from the image URL, correctly stripping query strings instead of splitting on `?`.
* Session: Adjusted `get_session()` using `wp_cache_set()` instead of `wp_cache_add()`, which caused stale persistent object cache entries to never be overwritten.
* Session: Adjusted `get_session()` and `update_cart()` using an uninitialized expiration value on frontend requests, preventing sessions from being cached after a database read.
* Session: Adjusted `save_data()` writing to object cache with a potentially negative TTL when session expiration was stale or unset.
* Session: Adjusted `update_cart()` not syncing the object cache after a database write, causing subsequent reads to return stale cached data.
* Session: Added `get_cache_expiration()` helper to reliably resolve cache expiration across both REST API and frontend contexts.

### Breaking Changes

* REST API: The `cocart_does_product_allow_price_change` filter now defaults to `false`. Price overrides via the `price` parameter on `cocart/v2/cart/add-item` are disabled by default. To restore the previous behaviour, add `add_filter( 'cocart_does_product_allow_price_change', '__return_true' );` — or return `true` conditionally for specific products only.

### Developers

* Logger: Log entries now include a source line identifying the calling class, method, file, and line number for easier debugging.
* Introduced new filter `cocart_etag_cart_routes` to customize which cart routes support ETag.
* Introduced new filter `cocart_etag_product_routes` to customize which product routes support ETag.
* Introduced new filter `cocart_etag_routes` to add ETag support for third-party plugin routes.
* Introduced new filter `cocart_cache_max_age` to customize cache duration (default: 1 hour).
* Introduced new filter `cocart_stale_while_revalidate` to customize stale-while-revalidate duration (default: 24 hours).

> Developer note: This allows you to then alter values such as the billing country. See example.

`
add_filter( 'cocart_get_customer_billing_country', function( $value ) {
	if ( WC()->countries->country_exists( $value ) ) {
		return WC()->countries->get_countries()[ $value ];
	}

	return $value;
}, 10, 1);
`

* Introduced new filter `cocart_get_after_customer_{field-type}_fields` that allows you to change the customer fields after they returned. Replace `{field-type}` with either `billing` or `shipping` for the fields to alter.
