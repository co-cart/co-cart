# Changelog for CoCart Community

## v4.9.0 - [DATE]

### What's New?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> PHP version 8.2 is the minimum requirement to install and use CoCart. PHP 7.4, 8.0, and 8.1 are all past end-of-life/security support so to help manage development resources to maintain CoCart, it will no longer be tested on these versions. Running CoCart on PHP 8.2 not only ensures you are secure but it also improves the performance of the CoCart API. Thank you for your understanding.

* REST API: Added ETag support for all cart endpoints (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) enabling conditional requests with `If-None-Match` header for immediate use.
* REST API: Added ETag support for product endpoints (products, categories, tags, attributes, reviews).
* REST API: Added `CoCart-Cache` response header indicating cache status: `HIT`, `MISS`, or `SKIP`.
* REST API: Added `_skip_cache` query parameter to bypass caching for individual requests.
* REST API: Added `stale-while-revalidate` directive to cacheable routes (products) for improved performance.
* REST API: Added check for `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header if it exists during authentication.
* WordPress Dashboard: New integrations page to provide more control over which supported plugin is running when making a CoCart request.

### Bug Fixes

* REST API: Slugs and permalinks with non-ASCII characters (e.g., Chinese, Arabic) are now returned decoded instead of URL-encoded across all product and cart endpoints.
* REST API: Authentication not determining user in time when `rest_url_prefix` filter is used causing several cloned guest sessions with cart items.
* REST API: Fixed fatal error when adding an invalid product to cart via v2 controller due to missing `WP_Error` check after product validation.
* REST API: Corrected `Last-Modified` header in GMT per HTTP spec with more robust date parsing.
* Plugin: Fixed `cocart_deprecated_filter()` returning `null` when the debug log was active, causing callers to receive no value from the deprecation wrapper.

#### PHP 8.2+ Fixes

* REST API: Fixed warnings for undefined array keys `cart_item_data` and `cart_item_key` in v1 add item controller.
* Session: Fixed warning for undefined array key `total` in session handler cart hash generation.
* Plugin: Fixed warnings for undefined array key `count` when database queries return no results in cart counting functions.
* Plugin: Fixed warning for undefined variable `$per_page` in admin plugin search.
* Plugin: Fixed deprecated `${var}` string interpolation syntax in plugin update screen.

### Change

* Session: Removed the max expiration exceed limit of 30 days to allow adjusting the lifetimes via the `cocart_cart_expiring` and `cocart_cart_expiration` filters as needed.

> Dev note: You will still be warned "Keeping sessions for longer than X days can cause performance issues and larger session tables."

### Improvements

* REST API: Slight performance increase by preventing admin content from loading in the background for every REST request made.
* REST API: `cocart_upload_file()` and `cocart_upload_image_from_url()` now use a `try/finally` block to guarantee the `upload_dir` filter is always removed, even when an exception is thrown during upload.
* REST API: `cocart_upload_image_from_url()` now uses `wp_parse_url()` to extract the filename from the image URL, correctly stripping query strings instead of splitting on `?`.
* Session: Adjusted `get_session()` using `wp_cache_set()` instead of `wp_cache_add()`, which caused stale persistent object cache entries to never be overwritten.
* Session: Adjusted `get_session()` and `update_cart()` using an uninitialized expiration value on frontend requests, preventing sessions from being cached after a database read.
* Session: Adjusted `save_data()` writing to object cache with a potentially negative TTL when session expiration was stale or unset.
* Session: Adjusted `update_cart()` not syncing the object cache after a database write, causing subsequent reads to return stale cached data.
* Session: Added `get_cache_expiration()` helper to reliably resolve cache expiration across both REST API and frontend contexts.

### Breaking Changes

* REST API: The `cocart_does_product_allow_price_change` filter now defaults to `false`. Price overrides via the `price` parameter on `cocart/v2/cart/add-item` are disabled by default. To restore the previous behaviour, add `add_filter( 'cocart_does_product_allow_price_change', '__return_true' );` — or return `true` conditionally for specific products only.

### Developers

* Logger: Log entries now include a source line identifying the calling class, method, file, and line number for easier debugging.
* Introduced new filter `cocart_etag_cart_routes` to customize which cart routes support ETag.
* Introduced new filter `cocart_etag_product_routes` to customize which product routes support ETag.
* Introduced new filter `cocart_etag_routes` to add ETag support for third-party plugin routes.
* Introduced new filter `cocart_cache_max_age` to customize cache duration (default: 1 hour).
* Introduced new filter `cocart_stale_while_revalidate` to customize stale-while-revalidate duration (default: 24 hours).

## v4.3.9 - 14th November 2024

### Security Patch

> Just a note: The security issue isn't directly related to CoCart itself, but we're here to help keep your store secure. Since CoCart is a public API, security patches will be released as soon as possible to prevent the issue from affecting your site, so you don't have to wait for a fix from the plugin causing it.
> We recommend updating to this version if you're using any WooCommerce plugins that might reveal public information.
> We want you to know that we would never publicly name a plugin with a security concern. However, if you notice any security issues with CoCart or another plugin connected to it, please [report the security vulnerability](https://cocartapi.com/security-policy/#Reporting-Security-Vulnerabilities) so we can address it quickly.
> Thank you for helping us keep CoCart safe for everyone!

## v4.3.8 - 7th November, 2024

* REST API: Only update cart item quantity if quantity is different when requested.
* REST API: Check cached price against price with tax mode not just the product price set.
* WordPress Dashboard: Adjusted notices to get cached for the current site should it be a multisite.

* Plugin: PHPStan used to help with correcting errors and inconsistencies.

## v4.3.6 - 23rd August, 2024

* WordPress Dashboard: Updated add-on update watcher.

## v4.3.2 - 19th July, 2024

### 🌋 Hot Fix

This release fixes 3 known issues that were reported. [issue #425](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues/425), [issue #426](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues/426), [issue #427](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues/427) that has been affected since version 4.2 of CoCart.

It was due to the optimizations made to allow CoCart to perform better. Unfortunately it had some unexpected side affects that were not picked up during testing. For that I am sorry. If you haven't rolled back to before 4.2 then this patch is highly recommended.

Previous patch releases will also be updated to prevent further sites from experiencing these issues for those who like to update to specific version of the plugin.

A hard lesson was learned here and hope you haven't lost trust in the plugin. I appreciate your feedback and support during this process.

Please don't forget to backup your site before updating.

### Corrections

* Plugin: Typo caused the WP-CLI commands to not register and crash when used with composer.
* REST API: The data exception class was oddly not loading when updating an item. Autoloader was not picking it up. Now it is required.
* REST API: Cart would empty but the subtotal would not reset.

### Improvements

* REST API: Ensure we have calculated totals before we get an item or update an item so we can identify them.

## v4.3.1 - 18th July, 2024 - Deprecated

### Hot fix

Forgot I removed the WooCommerce plugin headers before in v3.9 to prevent incompatibility warning message when using "HPOS" feature. Didn't come up as issue when testing until now. My bad. 🤦

## v4.3.0 - 17th July, 2024

### What's New?

In this release we have added a plugin update prevention system as a safety measure. For the moment it will detect for compatibility with minor releases while we are making adjustments but it's designed mostly for detecting major changes. All CoCart add-ons that we release will now check for CoCart's requirements and will help you decide to update or not until your ready to do so.

* Plugin: Added plugin headers to be used for detecting CoCart add-ons or plugins that support CoCart.
* WordPress Dashboard: Auto-updates are disabled should a CoCart add-on active have not tested with the latest release available.
* WordPress Dashboard: Update now link for CoCart opens up a modal listing none tested plugins with a confirmation.

### Improvements

* REST API: Ensure we have calculated totals before we restore the requested item so we can identify them.

### For Developers

> These filters are for site admins more than anything.

* Introduced filter `cocart_in_plugin_update_message` allows you to change the upgrade notice.
* Introduced filter `cocart_get_plugins_with_header` allows you to get the plugins that have a valid value for a specific header.
* Introduced filter `cocart_get_plugins_for_cocart` allows you to get plugins which "maybe" are for CoCart.

### Compatibility

* Tested with WordPress v6.6
* Tested with WooCommerce v9.1

## v4.2.2 - 12th July, 2024

### Reverting

We are reverting a change for destroying a session. Previous change causes a conflict with identifying the correct column with our session table and causes the cart not to clear.

## v4.2.1 - 11th July, 2024

### Hot Fix

When loading a cart from session a deprecated function was still triggered. It's now been removed to prevent failing.

## v4.2.0 - 11th July, 2024

In this release we have optimized our backwards compatibility with the session handler. As our session handler has to accommodate both native and headless support we originally forked the session handler to see what we needed to keep everything functional without breaking the core of WooCommerce. Now we have reviewed and noted down the changes made over time and we are happy to provide a refreshed version of our session handler that now provides only what we need while leaving everything else in the original session handler alone. Meaning now our session handler extends the WooCommerce session handler, making this release more compatibility with third party plugins and the new WooCommerce cart and checkout blocks.

We also no longer use cookies as a backup for headless. This should also help with the confusion of needing to pass along the session cookie or reading the cookie to extract the cart key and help with user switching much better. A cart key is provided in both the cart response and returned headers. Saving the cart key in your own cookie or local storage is fairly straight forward.

> We advise that you update on staging or local to check if you have used any of our experimental functions and filters that were added to the session handler to see if any have been deprecated. You can also see the list of deprecations below. If you have any questions about this update please contact us.

### What's New?

* REST API: Can now request a guest cart via a requested header `cocart-api-cart-key`.

This minor release is related to Yoast SEO support.

### Tweaks

* Unlocked a change made in **v3.4.0** by un-registering the rest field `yoast_head` for the Products API.

Originally it was to keep the JSON response valid because a bug at the time was causing the response to not return correctly. It was also to increase the performance of the response as Yoast SEO returns the same data twice just in a different format. Now the issue appears to be gone and recent feedback suggested this should be left on by default.

Other improvements for supporting third party plugins are in the works.

If you want to discuss supporting a third party plugin, [start a discussion](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/discussions) on the CoCart GitHub repository.

## v3.7.3 - 23rd June, 2022

Example of limiting products via category and tag. `wp-json/cocart/v2/products/?category=accessories&tag=hats`

> There was some confusion with this as the documentation said (query by ID) but the API schema said (query by slug). Now you can do either. This adjustment affects both API versions.

## v3.7.0 - 31st May, 2022

## v3.6.3 - 11th May, 2022

**🔥 This is a HOTFIX!**

> This reverts partially back to v3.6.1

## v3.6.2 - 10th May, 2022

## v3.4.1 - 4th April, 2022

> Dev note: I'm an idiot for not finding this issue sooner. The function `add_meta_query` was not committed when the products API add-on was merged with the core of CoCart. 🤦‍♂️ Please accept my apologies for the issue caused. 🙏

### Deprecated & Replacement

* Deprecated use of `wc_get_min_max_price_meta_query` function. Although it was *deprecated* in WooCommerce since **v3.6** there was never a replacement provided and it was still working. Now the function has just been copied into a new function `cocart_get_min_max_price_meta_query` and will no longer provide the debug warning. It can be improved in the future if needed.

## v3.4.0 - 28th March, 2022

### What's New?

* Tweak: Unregistered rest field `yoast_head` from the Products API to keep the JSON response valid and increase performance.

> The rest field `yoast_head_json` still remains.

## v3.3.0 - 24th March, 2022

### What's New?

* Enhancement: Appends the cart query (Load Cart from Session) to the checkout URL so when a user proceeds to the native checkout page from the native cart, it forces to load that same cart. - **Guest Customers ONLY**

> This was added due to some circumstances the cart failed to load then after on the checkout page via normal means.

### For Developers

* Introduced new filter `cocart_use_cookie_monster` to prevent destroying a previous guest cart and cookie before loading a new one via Load Cart from Session. Thanks to [Alberto Abruzzo](https://github.com/AlbertoAbruzzo) for contributing further feedback.

> Dev note: Helps should you find the web browser is displaying the "Cookie was rejected because it is already expired." in the console log and the cart did not load again on refresh despite the session still being valid.

## v3.2.0 - 17th March, 2022

### What's New?

* Enhancement: Moved products array to it's own object and returned pagination information in the response. - **Products API v2 ONLY!**

> Dev note: A small break but a good one thanks to the feedback from **[Alberto Abruzzo](https://github.com/AlbertoAbruzzo)**. This only affects when accessing all products with or without arguments set. Just need to access the array of products from an object not just from the response. What's also great about this enhancement is that any arguments set will also be appended to the pagination links making it easy for developers.

### Bug Fix

* Fixed: Plugin review notice reappearing even after it has been dismissed.

### Bug Fix

* When updating an individual item in cart, the product data is not passed when validating the quantity and was causing a fatal error. [[issue #319](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues/319)]

> Developer note: This is because an improvement was made when adding items to the cart using the same function that is used to validate the quantity and I forgot to update the parameters for when it's used to update an item. My bad.
