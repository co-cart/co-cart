Make your WooCommerce store headless with CoCart, a REST API designed for decoupling.

== Description ==

### Speed up your WooCommerce store by going headless

**Is your store slow? Looking to decouple away from WordPress?** [CoCart](https://cocartapi.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink) saves you countless hours of developing your own REST API to decouple WooCommerce. It provides a developer-friendly, out the box solution that is customizable to your requirements allowing you to build a headless store without limitations imposed by a WordPress theme‚Äîit's that simple.

#### What is WooCommerce?

WooCommerce is a **flexible, open-source commerce solution** built on WordPress, empowering anyone to **sell anything, anywhere** and is **the fastest-growing eCommerce platform** on the internet.

#### Why CoCart?

With CoCart, we have already done the hard part for you. The API. Once installed, your WooCommerce store is ready to decouple away from WordPress, allowing you to design without limitations imposed by a WordPress theme that is harder to modify and optimize. **Utilize faster, familiar frameworks you know and love**‚Äîit's that simple.

## ‚ú® What do you get with the core of CoCart?

**Everything you need to try** and see if making your store headless is right for you.

* **No Blocks** - The API is designed for the purpose of decoupling. Not blocks for Gutenberg.
* **Enhanced Session Handler** - Our session handler provides the support needed for any decoupled situation.
* **Basic Authentication** - No Admin API Keys required. Customers have full control, either as a guest or authenticated with their login details.
* **Domain dominance** - CORS can be an issue when decoupling. Don‚Äôt sweat the small stuff. We got you.
* **No Headless Checkout?** - Load any cart session via the native site, if you feel more comfortable using WooCommerce‚Äôs built in payment system.
* **Worried about Caching?** - The Cart API does not cache no matter what cache system you have installed for other API‚Äôs in use. Responses return fresh every time.
* **Reduced Cart Checkups** - Avoid the hassle of multiple requests to verify item and coupon validity in your cart. Our system efficiently checks stock, validates coupons, and calculates totals and fees, ensuring real-time accuracy before confirmation.
* **Need your own cart callback?** - Register custom callbacks without needing to create a whole new endpoint. Cart response returns once the callback is completed.
* **Your Inventory** - Search by Name, ID or SKU, filter and return product data you need without authentication. REST shortcuts are readily provided for your next requests.
* **Want to track your customers?** - Keep watch of all cart sessions, even the ones that are starting to expire.
* **Name Your Price Built In** - Give your customers control of the price they pay. Encourage your audience to support you with payment flexibility that widens your paying audience.
* **Bulk Requests** - Combine many cart requests in bulk to save time.

And this is just the tip of the iceberg.

> An excellent plugin, which makes building a headless WooCommerce experience a breeze. Easy to use, nearly zero setup time. [Harald Schneider](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-plugin-8062/)

## üõí Built for developers, by developers

CoCart was born out of frustration with **no existing solution on the market**. As beautiful as it functions, the API is just as flexible with you, the developer, in mind. We spend an unfathomable amount of time making the API a joy to work with.

We invest our time into fully abstracting our API so you can focus on building a headless store. Integrate with CoCart in days, not months.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is CoCart free? =

Yes! CoCart‚Äôs core features are absolutely free. [CoCart Plus completes the full cart experience!](https://cocartapi.com/pricing/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink)

= How do I start using CoCart? =

You will first need WooCommerce installed with the REST API enabled. Then install CoCart and follow the documentation.

> Please check the requirements listed in the [installation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/#installation) section.

= Who should use CoCart? =

CoCart is perfect for ecommerce owners and developers who want to create an ecommerce app for mobile or a custom frontend shopping experience completely using the REST API.

= Do I need to have coding skills to use CoCart? =

As this plugin provides a REST API built for developers, you will need to have some coding knowledge to use it.

= Where can I find documentation for CoCart? =

You can find the documentation [here](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink).

= Can I change the formatting of values, add and change details to the responses? =

You certainly can. There are over 100+ filters available to customize to your needs.

= Why does CoCart use a custom session handler in the first place? =

If you're familiar with WooCommerce, you may be wondering why using a custom session handler at all instead of the WooCommerce default session handler? A number of reasons but the ones that really matter are.

- The default session handler only supports cookies.
- The default session handler only saves changes at the end of the request in the `shutdown` hook.
- The default session handler has no support for concurrent requests.
- The default session handler **does not support guest customers**.
- The default session handler **does not store additional data that maybe required to help you**.
- More consistent with modern web.

= Why does CoCart use a custom session table in the database? =

The default WooCommerce session table only stores the basics of a cart in session. CoCart provides additional data that maybe required to help you and other add-ons/extensions developed by CoCart or third-parties.

Such as when the cart was created. This information is only stored in the browser session.

Also the source of the cart it was last saved. For the web it will be `WooCommerce` and for your headless ecommerce `CoCart`. This lets you know which version of your store your customers are shopping from should you have both web and app versions.

= Can I have WordPress running on one domain and my headless ecommerce on another domain? =

Yes of course. You just need to enable CORS. You can do that easily with [the CORS add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cocart-cors/) or you can manually enable it via the filters available [in the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/#filters-api-access-cors-allow-all-cross-origin-headers).

= Can I add "WooCommerce Subscriptions" product to the cart? =

Absolutely you can. Any WooCommerce Subscriptions product can be added to the cart the same way a simple or variable product is added to the cart.

= Why can I not add the same item to the cart with a different price? =

Each item added to the cart is assigned a cart item key which is made of four key values: **Product ID**, **Variation ID**, **Variation attributes** and **Cart item data**.

The price and quantity is not taken into account to make this key.

So if you add the same item to the cart but with a different price, the cart will look up the cart item key to see if it's already added to the cart before deciding to either:
    1. Add it as a new item.
    2. Update the quantity of the previous item, in your case the price.

= Is "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" plugin supported? =

Not at this time. "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" ignores any REST API from allowing the ability to calculate the taxes from TaxJar except for WooCommerce Blocks and JetPack. However, [TaxJar for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/) plugin is supported.

= Is "TaxJar for WooCommerce" plugin supported? =

If you have "[TaxJar for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/)" v3.2.5 or above and CoCart v3.0 or above installed... then yes, it is supported.

= Is CoCart right for my business? =

CoCart‚Äôs REST API makes it possible for businesses to build a complete custom storefront. It‚Äôs API-first, enabling your business to take the shopping experience to the next level.

Made by and for developers, CoCart immediately allows you to create sophisticated experiences fast with unlimited possibilities.

With our extensive documentation and resources available, CoCart is a plug and play solution that works out of the box.

Save yourself 80% of a headache and hours of development time.

= Can I use any modern stack? =

Yes you can use your preferred tools and favorite modern technologies like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) and more giving you endless flexibility and customization.

= Why CoCart and not WooCommerce Store API? =

Both API‚Äôs are unique for their individual purposes.

WooCommerce's Store API is designed for their [Gutenberg blocks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/) which only requires a fixed format and is still prone to be used on native storefronts.

It also only works with *Nonces* when you are on the site so for mobile apps or headless ecommerce, you will run into issues. It is also missing a lot of valuable information that developers require to help them.

CoCart's API is designed for decoupling away from WordPress and lets you build headless ecommerce using your favorite technologies. **No Nonces, no cookies required.**

CoCart is packed full of powerful features that are completely customizable making it possible for businesses to build a complete custom storefront how they want.

No matter the type of store you are running, CoCart helps you grow.

It‚Äôs made by and for developers and immediately allows you to create sophisticated experiences fast with unlimited possibilities with it‚Äôs plug and play solution that just works out of the box.

So even if you are new to building a headless ecommerce or already have a WooCommerce store and been wanting to go headless, now is the time to start.

Don't take my word for it. Checkout the testimonials left by startups, freelancers, agencies and many more.

= Can I install/update CoCart via Composer? =

Yes. The best method would be to install/update CoCart from the GitHub repository but you can also do so via [https://wpackagist.org/](https://wpackagist.org/search?q=cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce&type=plugin)

= Does CoCart work for multi-site network? =

Yes. Just install CoCart and activate it via the network and all sites will have CoCart enabled.

= Can I enable white labelling for CoCart? =

Yes you can. You will have to edit your `wp-config.php` file to add a new constant. [See guide for details](https://cocart.dev/articles/wp-config-php/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink#white-labelling).

= Where can I report bugs? =

Report bugs on the [CoCart GitHub repository](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues). You can also notify us via the support forum ‚Äì be sure to search the forums to confirm that the error has not already been reported.

= CoCart is awesome! Can I contribute? =

Yes, you can! Join in on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/blob/trunk/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and follow the [development blog](https://cocart.dev/news/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink) to stay up-to-date with everything happening in the project.

= Is CoCart translatable? =

Yes! CoCart is deployed with full translation and localization support via the ‚Äòcart-rest-api-for-woocommerce‚Äô text-domain.

= Where can I get help or talk other users about CoCart core? =

If you get stuck, you can ask for help in the [CoCart support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/) or [join the CoCart Community on Discord](https://cocartapi.com/community/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink) where you will find like minded developers who help each other out.
