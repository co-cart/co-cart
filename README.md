⚠️ This is the development branch of CoCart. For current stable branch [browse trunk](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/tree/trunk). ⚠️

You can also [follow @cocartapi](https://twitter.com/cocartapi) on Twitter for the latest development updates.

## What does it provide?

CoCart provides support for managing the user session, alternative options for doing this task do exist; however, their usage can be limited to applications of the same origin as the WordPress installation. This is due to WooCommerce using cookies to store user session tokens.

## Getting Started

📢 This repo is not package ready and must be **built** in order to activate the plugin. To begin you will need to make sure that you have installed all of the modules.

### Step 1

Clone the repo to your WordPress development `wp-content/plugins` folder. Don't forget the folder name `"cocart-dev"` at the end of the command. This will keep your development build separate from the plugin build.

```
git clone https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart.git cocart-dev
```

### Step 2

Then go into the cloned folder `cd cocart-dev` and proceed with the following commands.

> ⚠️ It's important that you run the first command correctly as is otherwise it ruins the rest of the process and you will have to start again.

```
npm install
composer install
composer install-cocart
```

At this point you are now ready to begin developing and testing.

Now you will have another folder `cocart` within your plugins folder. This makes CoCart package ready. You will then be able to activate it from your `WordPress Dashboard > Plugins`.

If you have contributed changes to any part of CoCart, make sure that you have kept a backup copy before running any composer command and if you want to test those changes locally, simply run `composer prep-test-build` and CoCart will be packaged together for you again.

## Updating CoCart Packages

As CoCart is now built modular, to keep up to date with all the development changes in all the default set modules you will need to pull them from their individual repositories.

```
composer update
composer update-cocart
```

This will pull the `master` branch of each package which is the development branch unless a tag is specified instead.
