A REST API that handles the frontend of WooCommerce that’s Easy and Powerful.

== Description ==

CoCart is a flexible, open-source solution to enabling the shopping cart via the REST API for [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/).

With [CoCart](https://cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart), running your WooCommerce store completely via the REST API is now possible. Control and manage the shopping cart with ease. Powerful options, clear responses and developer ready for any filtering required to your needs.

= Why should I use CoCart? =

WooCommerce REST API is created with developers in mind, so it can integrate with virtually any service and while it does allow developers to easily create and modify. It only allows them to scale a store so much to meet a client’s specifications without further custom development that will enable the stores customers access to the products in order to add them to the shopping cart.

If you are wanting to build a headless WooCommerce store then CoCart is your missing solution.

With [the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/) provided, you’ll learn how to enable the cart for your store in no time.

= Credits =

This plugin is created by [Sébastien Dumont](https://sebastiendumont.com).

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

Visit the [WooCommerce server requirements documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements/) for a detailed list of server requirements.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of CoCart, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "CoCart" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is CoCart free? =

Yes! CoCart’s core features are absolutely free. [CoCart Pro completes the full cart experience!](https://cocart.xyz/pricing/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart)

= How do I start using CoCart? =

You will first need WooCommerce v3.6 or higher installed with the REST API enabled. Then install CoCart and follow the documentation. That’s it!

= Who should use CoCart? =

CoCart is perfect for store owners and developers. If you want to create an e-commerce app for mobile or a custom frontend shopping experience completely using the REST API, then you need to use CoCart.

= Do I need to have coding skills to use CoCart? =

As this plugin is built for developers you will need to have some coding knowledge to use it. [Checkout the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz) to get some understanding.

= Where can I find documentation for CoCart? =

The documentation for CoCart can be [found here](https://docs.cocart.xyz/).

You certainly can. Filters are available to do just that (so long as you are using version 2.0+). [Checkout the tweaks plugin](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart-tweaks) to view or maybe use the examples provided.

= Does it work with any of the official WooCommerce libraries? =

Only if you request your customers to be logged in first. This is because all the official libraries require authentication which the cart does not require.

Yes but only those with administrator capabilities can and if persistent cart was left enabled. - [See documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/#get-customers-cart-contents) for more information.
