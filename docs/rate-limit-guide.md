Rate Limiting is available for CoCart. This is optional and disabled by default. It can be enabled by following [these instructions](#rate-limiting-options-filter).

The main purpose was to prevent abuse on endpoints from excessive calls and performance degradation on the machine running the store.

Rate limit tracking is controlled by either `USER ID` (logged in) or `IP ADDRESS` (unauthenticated requests).

It also offers standard support for running behind a proxy, load balancer, etc. This also optional and disabled by default.

## Limit information

A default maximum of 25 requests can be made within a 10-second time frame. These can be changed through an [options filter](#rate-limiting-options-filter).

## Methods restricted by Rate Limiting

`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`

## Rate Limiting options filter

A filter is available for setting options for rate limiting:

```php
add_filter( 'cocart_api_rate_limit_options', function() {
	return [
		'enabled' => RateLimits::ENABLED, // enables/disables Rate Limiting. Default: false
		'proxy_support' => RateLimits::PROXY_SUPPORT, // enables/disables Proxy support. Default: false
		'limit' => RateLimits::LIMIT, // limit of request per timeframe. Default: 25
		'seconds' => RateLimits::SECONDS, // timeframe in seconds. Default: 10
	];
} );
```

## Proxy standard support

If the Store is running behind a proxy, load balancer, cache service, CDNs, etc. keying limits by IP is supported through standard IP forwarding headers, namely:

- `X_REAL_IP`|`CLIENT_IP` *Custom popular implementations that simplify obtaining the origin IP for the request*
- `X_FORWARDED_FOR` *De-facto standard header for identifying the originating IP, [Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For)*
- `X_FORWARDED` *[Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded), [RFC 7239](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7239)*

This is disabled by default.

## Limit usage information observability

Current limit information can be observed via custom response headers:

- `RateLimit-Limit` *Maximum requests per time frame.*
- `RateLimit-Remaining` *Requests available during current time frame.*
- `RateLimit-Reset` *Unix timestamp of next time frame reset.*
- `RateLimit-Retry-After` *Seconds until requests are unblocked again. Only shown when the limit is reached.*

### Response headers example

```http
RateLimit-Limit: 5
RateLimit-Remaining: 0
RateLimit-Reset: 1654880642
RateLimit-Retry-After: 28
```

## Tracking limit abuses

This uses a modified `wc_rate_limit` table with an additional remaining column for tracking the request count in any given request window.
A custom action `cocart_api_rate_limit_exceeded` was implemented for extendibility in tracking such abuses.

### Custom tracking usage example

```php
add_action(
    'cocart_api_rate_limit_exceeded',
    function ( $offending_ip ) { /* Custom tracking implementation */ }
);
```

## Testing Guide

### Without proxy support

 1. Enable Rate Limiting by using the [options filter](#rate-limiting-options-filter).
 2. In a short window, keep making API requests.
 3. Check that RateLimit-xxx headers change on each request.
 4. Check that once you've hit the limit, an error response is returned. You can modify the limits using the [options filter](#rate-limiting-options-filter) to make it easier to test.

### With proxy support, do the same as before and

 1. Enable proxy support
 2. Make your requests with one of the following request headers containing always the same IP address:
    - X-Real-IP or Client-IP
    - [X-Forwarded-For](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For)
    - [Forwarded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded)

### User Facing Testing

 1. Enable Rate Limiting by using the [options filter](#rate-limiting-options-filter).
 2. Try to apply a coupon or access `/wp-json/cocart/v1/coupon` beyond current limits (currently 25 requests under 10 seconds)
 3. Ensure you get presented with an error "Too many requests. Please wait xx seconds before trying again."
