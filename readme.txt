A REST API that handles the frontend of WooCommerce that’s Easy and Powerful.

== Description ==

Build headless stores, **without building an API**

CoCart handles the shopping cart in any modern framework of your choosing. No local storing required. Powerful and developer friendly ready to build your headless store.

Built for [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/).

With [CoCart](https://cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart), running your WooCommerce store completely via the REST API is now possible. Control and manage the shopping cart with ease. Powerful options, clear responses and developer ready for any filtering required to your needs.

= Why should I use CoCart? =

The question is why not! WooCommerce's REST API is only created for controlling the backend of your store. Not the API your needing for your customers who only see the frontend.

If you are wanting to build a headless WooCommerce store then CoCart is your solution.

With [the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/) provided, you’ll learn how to enable the cart for your store in no time.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

Visit the [WooCommerce server requirements documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements/) for a detailed list of server requirements.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of CoCart, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "CoCart" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I start using CoCart? =

You will first need WooCommerce v3.6 or higher installed with the REST API enabled. Then install CoCart and follow the documentation. That’s it!

= Why should I use CoCart? =

The question is why not! WooCommerce's REST API is only created for controlling the backend of your store. Not the API your needing for your customers who only see the frontend.

If you are wanting to build a headless WooCommerce store then CoCart is your solution.

= Who should use CoCart? =

CoCart is perfect for store owners and developers. If you want to create an e-commerce app for mobile or a custom frontend shopping experience completely using the REST API, then you need to use CoCart.

= Do I need to have coding skills to use CoCart? =

As this plugin is built for developers, you will need to have some coding knowledge to use it. [Checkout the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz) to get some understanding.

= Where can I find documentation for CoCart? =
