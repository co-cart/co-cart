Make your WooCommerce store headless with CoCart, a REST API designed for decoupling.

== Description ==

Decouple your WooCommerce store with ease with our developer friendly REST API extension.

[CoCart](https://cocartapi.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink) is a **customizable, open-source REST API solution** built for WooCommerce that is ready to decouple away from WordPress, allowing you to design and build without limitations imposed by a WordPress theme that is harder to modify and optimize. Our REST API handles all the server side actions so it can be utilized in **faster and familiar frameworks** that you prefer.

#### Why WooCommerce?

WooCommerce provides a **flexible, and efficient** way to build cutting-edge stores with WordPress at it's core. But it was missing a key component to decouple WooCommerce via the REST API which is where CoCart comes in.

#### Why CoCart?

Is your store slow? Looking to decouple away from WordPress? Overwhelmed with getting WooCommerce working the way you want in your own REST API endpoints?

These are the struggles of web developers trying to decouple a WooCommerce store.

With CoCart, you can overcome these challenges and get straight to utilizing a REST API that is ready for you.

* **Source of Truth** - CoCart sources the WooCommerce's Data Stores API and repeats most WooCommerce hooks to provide a wider array of support for most WooCommerce extensions out of the box.
* **No Cookie Required** - Our session handler generates a key for the user session in the WordPress database and stores session-related meta data for use on the client without the heavy load.
* **Basic Authentication** - No Admin API Keys required. Customers can login with their account either with Email+Password, Username+Password, Phone Number+Password.
* **Domain Dominance** - CORS can be an issue when decoupling so we made sure you have control of the origin.
* **Your Inventory** - Search products by Name, ID or SKU, filter and return product data you need without authentication or private data exposed. REST shortcuts are readily provided for your next requests.
* **Reduced Cart Checkups** - We have avoided the hassle of needing multiple requests to verify item and coupon validity in your cart. Our system efficiently checks stock, calculates totals and fees, ensuring real-time accuracy so your responses return up to date every time.
* **No Headless Checkout?** - Load any cart session via the native site using the generated key, if you feel more comfortable using WooCommerce‚Äôs built in payment system.
* **Need your own cart callback?** - Register custom callbacks without needing to create a whole new endpoint. Cart response returns once the callback is completed.
* **Want to track your customers?** - Keep watch of all cart sessions, even the ones that are starting to expire or have expired.
* **Name Your Price Built In** - Give your customers control of the price they pay. Encourage your audience to support you with payment flexibility that widens your paying audience.
* **Bulk Requests** - Combine many cart requests in bulk to save time.

And this is just the tip of the iceberg.

> An excellent plugin, which makes building a headless WooCommerce experience a breeze. Easy to use, nearly zero setup time. [Harald Schneider](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-plugin-8062/)

## üõí Built for developers, by developers

CoCart was born out of frustration with **no existing solution on the market**. As beautiful as it functions, the API is just as flexible with you, the developer, in mind. We spend an unfathomable amount of time making the API a joy to work with.

We invest our time into fully abstracting our API so you can focus on building a headless store. Integrate with CoCart in days, not months.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does CoCart do? =

CoCart provides a REST API that is ready to decouple WooCommerce away from WordPress. It allows you to search products by Name, ID or SKU, filter and return product data you need without authentication, manage cart sessions for customers and avoids the hassle of needing multiple requests to verify item and coupon validity in your cart. It also efficiently checks stock, calculates totals and fees, ensuring real-time accuracy so your responses return up to date every time.

CoCart sources the WooCommerce‚Äôs Data Stores API and repeats most WooCommerce hooks to provide a wider array of support for most WooCommerce extensions out of the box.

= Who should use CoCart? =

Pretty much everyone, who wants a faster ecommerce store to improve their business. WooCommerce runs multiple requests for multiple steps. We avoid the hassle of needing multiple requests for these steps and process them all together.

CoCart is perfect for ecommerce owners and developers who want to create an ecommerce app for mobile or a custom frontend shopping experience completely using the REST API.

= Are there any limitations? =

CoCart is designed with developers in mind allowing for complete control to customize or add support for a plugin to work with CoCart. CoCart does it's best to work out of the box but if there is a compatibility issue with a plugin that you would like to work with CoCart. We would be happy to hear about it.

= What is the source of truth? =

CoCart sources the WooCommerce‚Äôs Data Stores API and repeats most WooCommerce hooks to provide a wider array of support for most WooCommerce extensions out of the box.

= Does CoCart work for multi-site network? =

Yes. Just install CoCart and activate it on the sites you want to use CoCart.

= Can I have WordPress running on one domain and my headless ecommerce on another domain? =

Absolutely. That is what CoCart is mainly developed for. You just need to enable CORS. You can do that easily with [the CORS add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cocart-cors/) or you can manually enable it via the filters available [in the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/#filters-api-access-cors-allow-all-cross-origin-headers).

= Will CoCart interfere with other plugins? =

The majority of plugins are not REST API specific so it shouldn't. However, while we allow the source of truth for compatibility, there maybe a WooCommerce extension that returns data via an action hook that the REST API cannot understand during a specific action and may fail the response.

If that does happen, simply report the situation with as much detail as possible on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues) and we will try our best to find a solution.

= How do I set up CoCart? =

You will first need WooCommerce installed and set up to your configurations. Then install CoCart, activate and your ready to start using the REST API following the API Reference provided.

> Please check the requirements listed in the [installation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/#installation) section.

= Why use CoCart and not WooCommerce‚Äôs Store API? =

WooCommerce‚Äôs Store API is designed for the [Gutenberg blocks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/) which only requires a fixed format and is still prone to be used on native storefronts. It also lacks validation on the server end which you will need and not every extensions yet works with it out of the box. A lot of valuable information and abilities that developers require to help them are also unavailable and if you try to use the Store API for headless you will have issues managing the cart sessions.

CoCart's API is designed for decoupling away from WordPress with ease. It's a plug and play solution that just works out of the box. Also, improvements are always made to CoCart to ensure you get the best decoupled experience.

= Do I need to have coding skills to use CoCart? =

As this plugin provides a REST API built for developers, you will need to have some coding knowledge to use it.

= Where can I find documentation for CoCart? =

You can find the documentation [here](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink).

= Can I change the formatting of values, add and change details to the responses? =

You certainly can. There are over 100+ filters available to customize to your needs.

= Why does CoCart use a custom session handler and table in the database? =

If you're familiar with WooCommerce, you may be wondering why using a custom session handler at all instead of the WooCommerce default session handler? A number of reasons but the ones that really matter are.

- The default session handler only supports cookies.
- The default session handler only saves changes at the end of the request in the `shutdown` hook.
- The default session handler has no support for concurrent requests.
- The default session handler **does not support guest customers**.
- The default session handler **does not store additional data that maybe required to help you**.
- The default session handler **does not allow support for POS capability**.
- More consistent with modern web.

= Is "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" plugin supported? =

No. "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" ignores any custom REST API's from allowing the ability to calculate the taxes from TaxJar except for WooCommerce Blocks and JetPack. We don't recommend it. However, [TaxJar for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/) plugin is supported.

= Is "TaxJar for WooCommerce" plugin supported? =

If you have "[TaxJar for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/)" v3.2.5 or above and CoCart v3.0 or above installed... then yes, it is supported.

= Can I use any modern stack? =

Yes you can use your preferred tools and favorite modern technologies like [Astro](https://astro.build/) ,[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) and more giving you endless flexibility and customization.

= Can I install/update CoCart via Composer? =

Yes. The best method would be to install/update CoCart from the GitHub repository but you can also do so via [https://wpackagist.org/](https://wpackagist.org/search?q=cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce&type=plugin)

= Where can I report bugs? =

== Changelog ==

= v4.2.0 - 11th July, 2024 =

In this release we have optimized our session handler making this release more compatibility with third party plugins. We also no longer use cookies as a backup for headless. This should also help with the confusion of needing to pass along the session cookie or reading the cookie to extract the cart key and help with user switching much better. A cart key is provided in both the cart response and returned headers. Saving the cart key in your own cookie or local storage is fairly straight forward.

> We advise that you update on staging or local to check if you have used any of our experimental functions and filters that were added to the session handler to see if any have been deprecated. You can also see the list of deprecations below. If you have any questions about this update please contact us.

### What's New?

* Can now request a guest cart via a requested header `cocart-api-cart-key`.

### Improvements

* Session Handler: Improved identifying cart without the need of cookies.
* Session Handler: Added new function `is_user_customer()` to check the user role is a customer when authenticated before migrating cart from guest.
* Authentication: Validation for invalid details was taking too long and failed to return an error message.
* REST API: Updating the customer details in cart will now take additional billing and shipping fields as meta data. Validation is required by the developer using filter `cocart_update_customer_fields`.
* REST API: Sanitized and formatted customer email address and phone number.
* REST API: Formatted customer postcode if validated.
* REST API: Product image sizes are now fetched using utility products class function `get_product_image_sizes()`. Cuts down on the filter `cocart_products_image_sizes` being in multiple places.
* REST API: Currency in cart API v2 now returns `currency_symbol_pos` and the currency symbol will now return based on the set currency without lookup.
* REST API: Improved headers returned and added nocache headers on authenticated requests.
* REST API: Simplified returning the cart key to the headers.
* REST API: Loading of the REST API optimized.
* Plugin: Moved `is_rest_api_request()` function to the main class so it can be utilized outside of the plugin.
* Plugin: Localization improvements.
* Plugin: Updated plugin review notice.
* Plugin: Code files organized better.

### Deprecations

* Removed the need to support web host "Pantheon" by filtering the cookie name.
* Removed our session abstract `CoCart_Session` that extended `WC_Session`. Any remaining functions have moved to our refreshed session handler.
* Function `CoCart_Session_Handler::destroy_cookie()` no longer used.
* Function `CoCart_Session_Handler::cocart_setcookie()` no longer used.
* Function `CoCart_Session_Handler::get_cart()` no longer used.

* Filter `cocart_cookie_supported` no longer used.
* Filter `cocart_set_cookie_options` no longer used.
* Filter `cocart_cart_use_secure_cookie` no longer used. Use `wc_session_use_secure_cookie` instead.
* Filter `cocart_is_cart_data_valid` no longer used.
* Returned headers `X-CoCart-API-Timestamp` and `X-CoCart-API-Version` no longer used.

### Developers

* Introduced new action hook `cocart_after_session_saved_data` fires after the session is saved.
* Introduced new filter `cocart_send_nocache_headers` to decide if nocache headers are sent.
* Some functions from the cart and products API v2 have been moved to there own utility class so they can be utilized outside of the plugin.
* Added utility function to check for coupon exists.
* Moved two functions from CoCart Plus to be utilized outside of the plugin.

* REST API: Callback for cart update now passes the cart controller class so we don't have to call it a new.
* REST API: Cart schema tweaks.
* REST API: Cart and Product schema are now cached for performance.
* Plugin: Added more inline documentation for action hooks and filters.
* Plugin: Improved database queries.
* Plugin: Updated to latest WordPress Code Standards.
* WordPress Dashboard: Added CoCart add-on auto updates watcher.
* WP-CLI: Updating CoCart via command will now remove update database notice.

### Developers

* REST API: Two new headers return for cart responses only. `CoCart-API-Cart-Expiring` and `CoCart-API-Cart-Expiration`.

> These two new headers can help developers use the timestamps of the cart in session for when it is going to expire and how long until it does expire completely.

* REST API: Error tracking is returned with the error responses when `WP_DEBUG` is set to true to help with any debugging.
* REST API: Class aliases have been added to API v2 controllers after changing the class names for consistency.
