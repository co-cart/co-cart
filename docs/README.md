# CoCart Handbook <!-- omit in toc -->

The CoCart API is written entirely in PHP, and reuses a lot of the existing cart logic (and filter hooks) within WooCommerce. As a result, many plugins that were originally built for the shortcode-based cart will continue to work with the CoCart API that consume it.

If your plugin is making heavy use of PHP templates, or utilizes hooks included in core templates of WooCommerce, you will probably need to use some of our own filter hooks to match the same data result in the CoCart API.

This handbook will help you with what you need.
