# How to contribute

* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Make the changes to your forked repository.
  * Ensure you use LF line endings - no crazy windows line endings. :)
* When committing, reference your issue (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the **master branch** of the WooCommerce Cart REST API repository. Existing maintenance branches will be maintained by me.

At this point you're waiting on me to merge your pull request. I'll review all pull requests, and make suggestions and changes if necessary.

Thanks for contributing to WooCommerce Cart REST API!
